##Steps (to get same setup as Piotr):
#get VQA using PP running for a near-Clifford circuit (in PP.jl), QAOA ansatz and TFIM, obc, calc exp value of energies
#choose a target state, MCMC sampling to get similar states as the target state (see impl. details)
#calc PP for all those states
#find noisy simulator in Julia (Qiskit Wrapper) or use NoiseModel of PP for the noisy simulations of cl. simul. states
#def linear_fit_fct to generate the fit
#corrrect the noisy observable
